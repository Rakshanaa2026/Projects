Iris Classification Project!!!


This machine learning project focuses on classifying the Iris dataset using the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, available in the scikit-learn module. The model achieved an impressive accuracy of 100%, establishing it as a reliable classifier for this particular dataset.

Highlights
Algorithm Choice: Implemented the KNN algorithm for classification.
Alternative Approach: While the project currently employs the KNN algorithm, logistic regression is another viable option for classification tasks.
High Accuracy: Achieved a 100% accuracy rate, indicating the model's effectiveness in classifying Iris flowers.
Collaboration Invitation: This project is open to collaboration. Feel free to explore, experiment with different algorithms, tweak hyperparameters, and contribute to the project's growth.

Explore and experiment with different algorithms or hyperparameters.
